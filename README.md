This project uses a GCS bucket as a DVC remote.



To run dvc pull, you must configure Google credentials (either via a shared service account key or gcloud auth application-default login).

Otherwise, you can download the dataset directly from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/denkuznetz/food-delivery-time-prediction and place it in data/.”
